# Project Name: SystemFailed (The Accountability Project)

## 1. The Philosophy (Crucial)
This is NOT a grievance redressal portal. This is a **digital memorial and accountability engine**. 
* **Narrative:** We do not call them "Accidents." We call them "Systemic Murders." 
* **Goal:** To document deaths caused by civic negligence (potholes, open drains, electrocution) in India and trace the responsibility up the chain of command.
* **Tone:** Urgent, dark, investigative, serious. Think "Criminal Database," not "Government Blog."

## 2. The Core Mechanic: "The Chain of Accountability"
Every incident reported must attempt to link the victim to the specific hierarchy of failure:
* **Level 1 (The Hazard):** The Pothole/Open Wire/Pit.
* **Level 2 (The Executor):** The Agency (PWD, BBMP, DJB, NHAI).
* **Level 3 (The Oversight):** The Ward Member / Local Engineer.
* **Level 4 (The Representative):** The MLA and MP (who control the funds).
* **Level 5 (The Head):** The Chief Minister (Buck stops here).

## 3. Open Source & Community Guidelines
* The code must be clean, modular, and easy for a junior developer to fork and fix.
* No hardcoded secrets.
* Data validation is strict (we cannot afford fake news, or the platform loses credibility).
